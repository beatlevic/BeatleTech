      <ul class="clearfix">
        <li><b>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, i7 2.7GHz quad-core, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM)</b><br>
          Primary development device. I tried last year's (2017)
          model, but didn't like the noise of the keyboard. The 2018
          model with the 3rd
          version of the Butterfly keyboard is nice and quiet. I'm
          also happy they finally put a quad-core CPU in the 13 inch
          model, but the touchbar is still an annoyance. Luckily I
          work 95% of the time with an external keyboard. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13%E2%80%91inch-spacegrijs-2,3%E2%80%91ghz-quad%E2%80%91core-512gb#">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2013, i7 2.8GHz, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM)</b><br>
          Backup development device. Still happy with its
          performance. However it could not support an external 4k monitor at 60hz.
          I also still have my Macbook Air 13 inch from 2011, which my
          wife is using now. Perhaps still my favorite macbook.
        </li>
        <li><b>LG Ultrafine 4K</b><br>
          I really like this 22" Monitor, which has apart from its
          size the same screen specs as
          the new macbook pro (dpi, brightness, color space) and
          supports True Tone. To raise the monitor to an ergonimic height
          (top of the screen at eye level), I simply use a stack of
          books. I was used to always work with a 16:10 24" monitor at
          1920 x 1200, which is close to the effective resolution of
          the Ultrafine at 2048 x 1152 (but 4 times as sharp). - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/HKMY2ZM/A/lg-ultrafine-4k%E2%80%91display">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Roost Stand</b><br>
          Recently I got 2 Roost laptop stands. One for at home and
          one for on the road. It's really compact and lightweight. - <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/collections/roost-laptop-stand/products/roost-laptop-stand">Roost Stand</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Apple Magic Keyboard 2</b><br>
          I really like the small size of this keyboard. As well as
          the typing experience. I prefer it over the new Macbook pro's
          butterfly keyboard - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MLA22N/A/magic-keyboard-nederlands">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Corsair M65 Mouse</b><br>
          For years I used the Apple Magic mouse, but using this
          gaming mouse, it is night and day. The magic mouse makes my
          hand feel tired, as I constantly keep my index and middle
          finger up in the air, to make sure it registers right-clicks.
          I also tried the Magic Trackpad 2, but found that even more
          tiring. I ordered the <a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/819399/logitech-mx-anywhere-2s-lichtgrijs.html">Logitec MX Anywhere 2S</a> for on the go.

        <li><b>Apple Watch Series 3</b><br>
          I actually bought the Apple Watch to avoid spending time on
          my phone, which really works for me. The functionality of
          the Watch is limited, but I miss it when I'm not wearing the
          Watch. I additionally use it to track my running activities
          and for automatically unlocking my Macbook (super convenient)- <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch/42mm-gps-spacegrijs-aluminium-zwart-sportbandje">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sony MDR-ZX750BN</b><br>
          Once I received this headset for free when I bought a Sony
          smartphone. I find it comfortable to wear for long periods
          of time. I did try the Bose quiet comfort series, but active
          noiseconcellation makes me nauseous. - <a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/382395/sony-mdr-zx750bn-(zwart).html">Tweakers</a>

        <li><b>iPhone 8</b><br>
          After my iPhone SE, which was my first iPhone, I was hooked
          on IOS and really like my iPhone 8. I like my phone to be
          small, so I didn't go for the iPhone X. Together with a
          wireless charing pad from mophie, it was a great upgrade. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-8/4,7-inch-display-64gb-spacegrijs#00,12,20">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>iPad 2017</b><br>
          I use my iPad for browsing the web on the couch. My older
          iPad 2, was simply getting too slow for that. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/ipad-9.7/">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Kindle Oasis</b><br>
          I upgraded from a Kindle Paperwhite, and really like its
          size, weight and physical page-turn buttons. - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Oasis-eReader-with-Leather-Charging-Cover/dp/B00REQKWGA">Amazon</a>
