      <ul class="clearfix">
        <li><b>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, i7 2.7GHz quad-core, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM)</b><br>
          Primary development device. I tried last year's (2017) model, but didn't like the noise of the
          keyboard. The 2018 model with the 3rd version of the Butterfly keyboard is nice and quiet. I'm also
          happy they finally put a quad-core CPU in the 13 inch  model, but the Touchbar is still an
          annoyance. Luckily I work 95% of the time with an external
          keyboard. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13%E2%80%91inch-spacegrijs-2,3%E2%80%91ghz-quad%E2%80%91core-512gb#">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2013, i7 2.8GHz, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM)</b><br>
          Backup development device. Still happy with its performance. However it could not support an
          external 4k monitor at 60hz. I also still have my Macbook Air 13 inch from 2011, which my wife is
          using now. Perhaps still my favorite macbook.
        </li>
        <li><b>LG Ultrafine 4K</b><br>
          I really like this 22" Monitor, which has apart from its size the same screen specs as the new Macbook Pro (dpi, brightness, color space) and supports True Tone. To raise the monitor to an ergonomic height
          (top of the screen at eye level), I simply use a stack of books. I was used to always work with a
          16:10 24" monitor at 1920 x 1200, which is close to the effective resolution of the Ultrafine at
          2048 x 1152 (but 4 times as
          sharp). - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/HKMY2ZM/A/lg-ultrafine-4k%E2%80%91display">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Roost Stand</b><br>
          Recently I got 2 Roost laptop stands. One for at home and
          one for on the road. It's really compact and lightweight. - <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/collections/roost-laptop-stand/products/roost-laptop-stand">Roost Stand</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Apple Magic Keyboard 2</b><br>
          I really like the small size of this keyboard. As well as
          the typing experience. I prefer it over the new Macbook Pro's
          butterfly keyboard - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MLA22N/A/magic-keyboard-nederlands">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Corsair M65 Mouse</b><br>
          For years I used the Apple Magic mouse, but using this
          gaming mouse, it is night and day. The magic mouse makes my
          hand feel tired, as I constantly keep my index and middle
          finger up in the air, to make sure it registers right-clicks.
          I also tried the Magic Trackpad 2, but found that even more
          tiring. I ordered the <a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/819399/logitech-mx-anywhere-2s-lichtgrijs.html">Logitec MX Anywhere 2S</a> for on the go.

        </li>
        <li><b>Apple Watch Series 3</b><br>
          I actually bought the Apple Watch to avoid spending time on
          my phone, which really works for me. The functionality of
          the Watch is limited, but I miss it when I'm not wearing the
          Watch. I additionally use it to track my running activities
          and for automatically unlocking my Macbook (super convenient)- <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch/42mm-gps-spacegrijs-aluminium-zwart-sportbandje">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sony MDR-ZX750BN</b><br>
          Once I received this headset for free when I bought a Sony
          smartphone. I find it comfortable to wear for long periods
          of time. I did try the Bose quiet comfort series, but active
          noise cancellation makes me nauseous. - <a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/382395/sony-mdr-zx750bn-(zwart).html">Tweakers</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>iPhone 8</b><br>
          After my iPhone SE, which was my first iPhone, I was hooked
          on IOS and really like my iPhone 8. I like my phone to be
          small, so I didn't go for the iPhone X. Together with a
          wireless charging pad from Mophie, it was a great upgrade. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-8/4,7-inch-display-64gb-spacegrijs#00,12,20">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>iPad 2017</b><br>
          I use my iPad for browsing the web on the couch. My older
          iPad 2, was simply getting too slow for that. - <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/ipad-9.7/">Apple</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Kindle Oasis</b><br>
          I upgraded from a Kindle Paperwhite, and really like its
          size, weight and physical page-turn buttons. - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Oasis-eReader-with-Leather-Charging-Cover/dp/B00REQKWGA">Amazon</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Remote Server</b><br>
          For extra horse power I have a couple of remote servers
          at <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/?country=ot">Hetzner</a>. They are located  relatively close by
          in Germany, and are dirt cheap for their dedicated servers. Especially compared to AWS (10x cheaper
          for the same performance). - <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex51-ssd-gpu">Hetzner GPU</a>

        <li><b>Chair</b><br>
          I tried
          the <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/">Herman
          Miller Aeron</a> chair, but found it cutting of the blood
          circulation in my upper legs :/ So I
          contacted and visited <a href="http://www.scholtenswerkplek.nl">Scholtens
          Werkplek</a> for advise and they suggested the RH
          Logic400XL. The owner personally delivered the chair to my
          home and helped adjusting the chair for my posture. I'm still really happy
          with this chair and highly recommend seeing Scholtens to get
          your own personal advise. - <a href="http://www.scholtenswerkplek.nl/rh-stoelen-rh-logic-400.html">Scholtens</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>Desk</b><br>
          I use a wooden dining table, which has the ideal desk height
          for me at 78.5cm. I haven't really tried a standing desk
          yet, but may venture into trying this some day (read: not
          any time soon).

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p class="publishdate">All the software I install when setting up
    a new Laptop, and which I use on a daily basis.
      <ul class="clearfix">
        <li><b>Emacs</b><br>
          Primary Editor. I'm using Emacs for the past 10 years, and while I have tried other IDEs like Text Mate,
          Sublime Text and IntelliJ, I keep coming back to Emacs and keep iterating  on my .emacs.d settings
          (<a href="https://github.com/beatlevic/dot-emacs">Source</a>). On remote servers I switch to VIM.
        </li>
        <li><b>iTerm 2</b><br>
          With <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish Shell</a>. And of course the unofficial package manager for
          MacOS: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Brew</a>, which makes any package just one install command away (e.g. "brew
          install htop").
        </li>
        <li><b>Google Chrome</b><br>
          I got used to its developer tools and like the overall speed of the browser. I'm already giving all
          my data to Google by using Gmail, so I don't mind using Chrome... Additionally I use a couple of helpful
          ad-blocking extensions, and really enjoy
          the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a>
          extension, which gives me shortcuts for website navigation to help me leave the mouse alone.
        </li>
        <li><b>Bear</b><br>
          I recently discovered <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a>, which is a beautiful note
          taking app. I used to use Evernote, but found it to become increasingly slow. Bear is what Evernote
          should be, with great and sane keyboard bindings together with a lovely minimalistic design. Bear
          can also import all your notes from Evernote.
        </li>
        <li><b>iStat Menus</b><br>
          I like keeping a close eye on my system's resources and
          find <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat menus</a> great for that.
        </li>
        <li><b>Dropbox</b><br>
          I primarily use Dropbox, where I also automatically upload my iPhones Camera roll. I Also use Google
          cloud and iCloud for backups.
        </li>
        <li><b>Slack</b><br>
          I like Slack as a separate app and not only in the Browser. Unfortunately application speed seems
          like an afterthought.
        </li>
        <li><b>1 Password</b><br>
          The first password manager I tried, and I never left.
        </li>
        <li><b>Beamer app</b><br>
          To Stream any movie or series to my AppleTV in the living room I
          use <a href="https://beamer-app.com/">Beamer</a>, which works flawlessly for me. For playing videos
          on laptop I use <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Caffeine</b><br>
          Keeps your Macbook awake. <a href="https://caffeine.en.softonic.com/mac">Caffeine</a> is especially
          handy when giving presentations.
        </li>
        <li><b>Apptivate</b><br>
          MacOS doesn't allow you to natively add shortcuts to open/switch applications, so I
          use <a href="http://www.apptivateapp.com/">Apptivate</a> for that. I have my primary applications
          linked to CMD-1 (Emacs), CMD-2 (iTerm 2), CMD-3 (Chrome) and CMD-4 (Slack).
          I keep these applications at Full screen, but all in one single space to avoid the slow space
          switching animation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Google plus screensaver photos</b><br>
          Locking my screen gives me a <a href="https://plus.google.com/featuredphotos">screensaver</a> that
          shows beautiful photos from all over the world. I linked CMD-0 to start the screensaver and lock my
          machine (Created a service with Automator).
        </li>
        <li><b>BetterSnapTool</b><br>
          For keyboard shortcuts to Maximize windows, or fill the right/left/top/bottom half of the screen I
          use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12">BetterSnapTool</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>BetterTouchTool</b><br>
          Additionally to BetterSnapTool, its sibling <a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a> allows
          me to customize the Touchbar beyond what is possible by MacOS itself. I dislike the Touchbar
          lighting up when I use the external keyboard, so I configured BetterTouchTool to turn it completely
          off. By pressing "fn" I can toggle to the default Touchbar controls, and holding "fn" shows me the
          Function keys (ESC, F1, F2, etc). I hope Apple backtracks on the Touchbar and drops it from future Macbooks.
