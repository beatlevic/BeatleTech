    <h2>Software Architect and Data Scientist</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm a Deep Learning Software Engineer
      at <a href="http://thinktopic.com">ThinkTopic</a>, a company specialized in Data Science,
      Machine Learning, Computer Vision, distributed systems, and custom application development. In
      my software engineering role Iâ€™m focussing on the Machine Learning components by applying Deep
      Learning techniques for learning Neural Networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to my work at ThinkTopic I'm also
      working part-time as Senior Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.othot.com">OThot</a>, where
      we try to harness the power of predictive analytics to improve business decisions for our
      clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to ThinkTopic I was both Chief Architect and Data Scientist
      at <a href="http://www.bottlenose.com">Bottlenose</a>, a trend intelligence platform focused
      on historical and real-time analytics for Fortune 500 companies. With the company we raised
      over $15M in capital and had KPMG leading
      our <a href="http://beatletech.com/2015/02/09/bottlenose-series-b/">Series B</a> round.
    </p>
    <p>
      I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology with
      minors in Psychology and Philosopy (at Leiden University). In Delft I continued pursuing a
      Ph.D. in Machine Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years into the Ph.D. program I decided to leave university and join
      startup <a href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> in Amsterdam (acquired in 2014) to build
      their recommender system. This valuable experience inspired me to found my own startup
      Newcope, a platform for predictive analytics of virtual goods. Newcope got seed funded
      by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, which started of a roller coaster
      adventure in the heart of Silicon Valley, where I became part of the YC alumni network.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main interest is Data Science with a special focus on Deep Learning, Machine Learning,
      Predictive Analytics and scaling out to handle big data.

      Besides software development I'm also interested in advisory roles and business strategies. As a founder of
      a Y Combinator startup and Chief Architect of the fast growing company Bottlenose, I had my fair share of the
      emotional rollercoaster that every entrepreneur goes through, which are valuable experiences I love to share.
