    <h2>Software Architect and Data Scientist</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm both Chief Architect and Data Scientist at <a href="http://bottlenose.com">Bottlenose</a>, a trend intelligence platform focused on historical and real-time analytics for Fortune 500 companies. I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology with minors in Psychology and Philosopy (at Leiden University). In Delft I continued pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years into the Ph.D. program I decided to leave university
      and join startup <a href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> in
      Amsterdam (acquired in 2014) to build their recommender system. This valuable experience inspired me to found my own startup Newcope, a platform for predictive analytics of virtual goods. Newcope got seed funded by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, which started of a roller coaster adventure in the heart of Silicon Valley, where I became part of the YC alumni network. After Newcope and freelance work, I joined the aforementioned company Bottlenose, where I continue to work on predictive analytics and scalable big data solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main interest is Data Science with a special focus on Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics and scaling out to handle big data.

      Besides software development I'm also interested in advisory roles and business strategies. As a founder of
      a Y Combinator startup and Chief Architect of the fast growing company Bottlenose, I had my fair share of the
      emotional rollercoaster that every entrepreneur goes through, which are valuable experiences I love to share.
