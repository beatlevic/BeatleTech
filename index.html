    <h2>Software Architect and Data Scientist</h2>
    <p>
      I recently worked as a Deep Learning Software Engineer
      at <a href="http://thinktopic.com">ThinkTopic</a>, a company specialized in Data Science,
      Machine Learning, Computer Vision, distributed systems, and custom application development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year I also worked part-time as Senior Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.othot.com">OThot</a>, where
      I worked on the Data Science component of their predictive
      analytics SAAS solution, which included setting up an ETL pipeline and developing machine
      learning models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to ThinkTopic I was both Chief Architect and Data Scientist
      at <a href="http://www.bottlenose.com">Bottlenose</a>, a trend intelligence platform focused
      on historical and real-time analytics for Fortune 500 companies. With the company we raised
      over $15M in capital and had KPMG leading
      our <a href="http://beatletech.com/2015/02/09/bottlenose-series-b/">Series B</a> round.
    </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> with
      minors in Psychology and Philosopy (at Leiden University). In Delft I continued pursuing a
      Ph.D. in Machine Learning.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="http://ycombinator.com"><img src="images/ycombinator.png" alt="" align="center" /></a></h2>
    <p>
      Two years into the Ph.D. program I decided to leave university and join
      startup <a href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> in Amsterdam (acquired in 2014) to build
      their recommender system. This valuable experience inspired me to found my own startup
      Newcope, a platform for predictive analytics of virtual goods. Newcope got seed funded
      by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, which started of a roller coaster
      adventure in the heart of Silicon Valley, where I became part of
      the YC alumni network.
