[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
[Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)
[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)

## Machine Learning

Machine learning refreshing knowledge

## Algorithms: Design and Analysis

Exploring [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
Building experience with Python (vs project euler).

## Bioinformatics

Exploring the bioinformatics domain

## Learning How to Learn

Really getting the hang of following online courses, wanted to make sure that what I learned would not be in vain, i.e. ephimeral and quickly forgotten when moving onto other topics of interest.

## What's next?

In 2015 I want to at least take the following courses, of which the first two are continuations of two courses I already completed:

[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)
[Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics2)
[Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm)

Additionaly I'm looking forward to follow more courses specialized in the field of bioinformatics (e.g. genetics, biomedicine, evolution, neuroscience) and Data Science (mining datasets, pattern discovery, advanced statistics)
