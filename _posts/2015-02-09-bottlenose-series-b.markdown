One and a half years after securing our
[$3.6 Million](http://beatletech.com/2013/07/30/bottlenose-secures-four-million/)
series A investment round to bring 'Trendfluence' to the enterprise, we are now
proud at [Bottlenose](http://bottlenose.com) to have raised (and
continue to raise) our series B round with a staggering amount of $13.4
Million, bringing the total raised funds north of $17 Million.

Back in December we already disclosed that KPMG International took a
["substantial equity share"](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kpmg-capital-takes-equity-stake-in-bottlenose-a-pioneer-in-real-time-trend-intelligence-300005792.html) in Bottlenose, but did not yet reveal the
size of the investment nor names of other investors that were ready to
follow KPMG Capital's lead. Today Techcrunch reported on our Series B
round, listing our additional investors and describing our growing
capabilities in enterprise (real-time) stream data analytics. The
series B round is still open and we plan to raise significant venture
debt on top of the $13.4 million.

At Bottlenose we are having exciting times ahead of us.
