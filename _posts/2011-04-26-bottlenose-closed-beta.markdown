I guess most of you have heared about "stealth" startup <a
href="http://bottleno.se">Bottlenose</a>, which already got some great pre
release write-ups on <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/05/bottlenose/">Techcrunch</a> and <a
href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/05/bottlenose/">Mashable</a>.

In case you haven't, Bottlenose describes itself as "a smarter way to surf the Stream. It's a new
personalization tool that helps the important information find you in
social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Use Bottlenose to track
your interests, visualize trends, and curate knowledge with your
friends." (Bottleno.se)

The Netherlands doesn't feature that many high tech startups, so I was
happy to work together with cofounder <a href="dominiek.com">Dominiek
ter Heide</a> this month (who helped us out last year with our YC company <a href="newcope.com">Newcope</a>).
Armed with Node.js my goal is to, where possible, make the tool even smarter than it already is.
For this challenge it helps a lot to be part of a highly skilled javascript team, who are
pushing the boundaries forward. And besides being a cool high tech product
to work on, I also believe Bottlenose is a must needed solution for an
information overload problem that is getting bigger each day.

Bottlenose is currently in alpha, but you can sign up now on <a
href="http://bottleno.se">Bottleno.se</a>, and hopefully be one
of the lucky ones for the closed beta to have early access to a tool that will enrich your
twitter and facebook experience.
