With BeatleTech life and kicking, I found it about time to add some blogging
functionality, and to start writing about my ongoing work, research and
serendipity events.

In my ongoing work you will find me blogging about my emacs journey,
my clojure lessons, rails mambo, and basically any other technology I
will be working with. Further more in my research I will cover topics in
cognitive science, human perception and AI, but all in due time.

If you are in need for an architect, developer or advisor, then know that
BeatleTech is there for you, and Beatle is available for hire!
