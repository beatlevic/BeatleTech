<p>Two months ago a good friend of mine (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosejn">Jeff Rose</a>), who is a
former <a href="http://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> engineer (acquired by Google), presented me with an
opportunity to come work at <a href="http://thinktopic.com">ThinkTopic</a> to build intelligent tools for a big
publisher that involves image search, collaborative filtering, an intelligent catalog, and much more
by applying Deep Learning techniques for learning in Neural Networks. Additionally most development
work would be done in <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> (a Lisp dialect on the JVM), which for me really
is the icing on the cake, being a longtime Clojure and functional programming fan.</p>

<p>So after almost 4 years of working as Chief Architect and Data Scientist at
<a href="http://bottlenose.com">Bottlenose</a>, I decided to take on this new challenge to start working for
ThinkTopic, of which today is my first day.</p>

<p>I had a great time at Bottlenose working with a great group of people. It has been amazing to see
the company grow to where it is right now, and the potential of where it could go. Getting the
<a href="http://beatletech.com/2015/02/09/bottlenose-series-b/">KPMG investment</a> has been a great milestone
and together with all the work over the years the idea of no longer being part of Bottlenose feels a
bit weird. Bottlenose has given me a lot in terms of experience, joy and friendships.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m keeping my desk at the Hackers and Founders building in Amsterdam, so I’m not
going cold turkey on my former colleagues (only switching rooms).</p>

<p>I’m excited to go on this new ThinkTopic adventure, which for today means diving back into
Convolutional Neural Networks. May the fun and challenge begin.</p>
