<p>With BeatleTech life and kicking, I found it about time to add some blogging
functionality, and to start writing about my ongoing work, research and
serendipity events. </p>

<p>In my ongoing work you will find me blogging about my emacs journey,
my clojure lessons, rails mambo, and basically any other technology I
will be working with. Further more in my research I will cover topics in
cognitive science, human perception and AI, but all in due time.</p>

<p>If you are in need for an architect, developer or advisor, then know that
BeatleTech is there for you, and Beatle is available for hire!</p>
