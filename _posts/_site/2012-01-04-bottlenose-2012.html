<p>The past couple of months I have been busy working for <a href="http://bottlenose.com">Bottlenose</a>, for which I did some work
before (earlier in 2011). As I wrote about Bottlenose in a previous
post, it is a really cool (American) tech startup partly based in the
Netherlands that is building a new social assistance application that
helps you make sense of all your social activity streams. It helps
navigate the depths of your networks and keep up with your social
streams so you can engage more intelligently.</p>

<p>I really enjoy working on all the technical challenges that we need to
tackle to create a smart and intelligent client. Challenges involving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
  <li>Interest and Topic extraction/clustering</li>
  <li>Interest (machine) learning</li>
  <li>High concurrency, handling millions of users</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of 2011 Bottlenose operated in stealth mode, until we were ready
in December 2011 to launch the Beta version to the public. The launch
was a great success and we got loads of positive <a href="http://press.bottlenose.com/news">media coverage</a>.</p>

<p>This year I will continue to work for Bottlenose as their chief architect and allround
(Node.js) developer. I love to see where we will get with Bottlenose in 2012.</p>

<p>Bottlenose = Node.js = #winning</p>
