The past couple of months have been very busy. First off I was still working partime
for <a href="http://skylines.net">Skylines</a> with which we made it
into <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch</a> <a
href="http://www.dutchdailynews.com/skylines-nyc/">Disrupt</a> NY as a
finalist. Skylines was actually the first Dutch startup ever to become a
finalist of this highly rated conference competition. Great stuff,
showing that Amsterdam can be a great place too when it comes to
bootstrapping your global startup.

Next, starting in April, I was hired as a Rails developer by <a
href="http://www.ciber.com/application-development/">Ciber</a> on a scrum
project for their client <a
href="http://www.malmberg.nl/Voortgezet-onderwijs/ePack-ICT/Nieuwe-generatie-methodes/Introductie.htm">Malmberg</a>,
an educational publisher, to work on the next iteration of their
e-publishing platform. The work consisted of a redesign of the old
platform, and developing a Rails 3 application on top of the existing
data models and MSSQL database (Rails 3 actually works perfectly fine with
other sql dbs besides Mysql and Postgres). The application allows for
teachers to manage their online courses, materials, exams and results,
where students have easy access to all of this. The system is actually
pretty smart in assigning followup courses based on your test scores,
but still gives teachers total control.

Unfortunately I can't show a link to the product or demo, as the
application is currently being tested by the client, and will be rolled
out for the new students in september. However I can say that I like
the end product.

I strongly believe we will see a lot more development in this
area of online learning platforms. Looking for instance at the <a
href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> or <a
href="http://studyflow.com">Studyflow</a> we can see that the
landscape is changing. Also a word from my teacher friends tells me that the
Dutch curriculum on both primary and high schools is already filled with more and
more computer courses, that provide custom tailored education for each
individual youngster.

I enjoyed my work at Ciber, working with a great team of skilled
developers, and I don't rule out that I in the foreseeable future will
be working on next generation learning platforms again.
