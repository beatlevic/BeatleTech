In the past couple of months I managed to complete 4 online courses on
[Coursera](http://coursera.com), which is an education platform that partners with top universities
to offer free [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) (Massive open online
courses). In this post I like to present you my experiences with my completed courses and my plans for any
future courses.

The reason for me to start following online courses has to do with what I already pointed out in my
previous blog post "[My System to Win Big](http://beatletech.com/2015/01/31/my-system)". I want to
keep on improving myself and acquire more knowledge in domains of my interest. Part of it is
revisiting knowledge I'm "supposed" to know to gain an even better understanding, and the other part
is exploring new uncharted territories. I also wanted to follow courses where I would have to
practise and hone my programming skills.

But why follow online courses with a rigid schedule and deadlines if you can simply read and study books or solve some tough problems on
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) at your own pace?

Discipline, structure



Statement of accomplishments

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
- [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
- [Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)

### Courses
#### Machine Learning

Stanford university

Matlab (vs Octave)

Machine learning refreshing knowledge.

Bottlenose focus on Data science

June-September 2014, 12 weeks of study, 6 hours per week,

#### Algorithms: Design and Analysis

Stanford university.

Besides Building more experience with Python (vs project euler).
Exploring [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)

October-December 2014, 6 weeks of study, 7 hours per week

#### Bioinformatics

Exploring the bioinformatics domain

UC San Diego.

October 2014 - Feb 2015, 10 weeks of study, 10 hours per week

distinction

#### Learning How to Learn

Really getting the hang of following online courses, wanted to make sure that what I learned would
not be in vain, i.e. ephimeral and quickly forgotten when moving onto other topics of interest.


January 2015, 4 weeks of study, 2 hours per week

### What's next?

In 2015 I want to at least take the following courses, of which the first two are continuations of
two courses I already completed:

- [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)
- [Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics2)
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm)

Additionaly I'm looking forward to follow more courses specialized in the field of bioinformatics
(e.g. genetics, biomedicine, evolution, neuroscience) and Data Science (mining datasets, pattern
discovery, advanced statistics)

Also want to finish Linear and Integer Programming, which I only completed 2/7 weeks and dropped due
to time constraints of other overlapping courses.
