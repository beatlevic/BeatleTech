As I already pointed out in my previous blog post ([My System](http://beatletech.com/2015/01/31/my-system)

A couple of months ago I


In the past couple of months I have tried a couple of online courses of which I eventually finished
four of them.

Gradually started doing the following courses.

After the first course I was hungry for more.

Wanted to follow courses with actual programming excercises

Statement of accomplishments

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
- [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
- [Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)

### Courses
#### [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)

Stanford university

Matlab (vs Octave)

Machine learning refreshing knowledge.

Bottlenose focus on Data science

June-September 2014, 12 weeks of study, 6 hours per week,

#### [Algorithms: Design and Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)

Stanford university.

Besides Building more experience with Python (vs project euler).
Exploring [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)

October-December 2014, 6 weeks of study, 7 hours per week

#### [Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)

Exploring the bioinformatics domain

UC San Diego.

October 2014 - Feb 2015, 10 weeks of study, 10 hours per week

distinction

#### [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)

Really getting the hang of following online courses, wanted to make sure that what I learned would
not be in vain, i.e. ephimeral and quickly forgotten when moving onto other topics of interest.


January 2015, 4 weeks of study, 2 hours per week

### What's next?

In 2015 I want to at least take the following courses, of which the first two are continuations of
two courses I already completed:

- [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)
- [Bioinformatics Algorithms, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics2)
- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm)

Additionaly I'm looking forward to follow more courses specialized in the field of bioinformatics
(e.g. genetics, biomedicine, evolution, neuroscience) and Data Science (mining datasets, pattern
discovery, advanced statistics)

Also want to finish Linear and Integer Programming, which I only completed 2/7 weeks and dropped due
to time constraints of other overlapping courses.
