Back in January 2014 I read a book by Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame) titled:
["How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17859574-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big).
The book was brought to my attention when I was reading up on some interesting research and ideas on
passion and discipline ([Carl Newport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwOdU02SE0w) comes to mind,
explaining why following your passion is bad career advice). Reading Adam's book definitely struck a
chord with me and even motivated me to change my work flow and longheld believes on what to focus on
in life. Two things stood out for me:

- Passion is bullshit. It is only after you have put in the work and are lucky enough in having
success that passion comes, not before.
- Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners.

Before reading the book I have often asked myself questions like: What is my greatest passion and am I working
every day on the things I'm most passionate about? What kind of startup or company would fit my passion? I
often had a hard time trying to find the perfect answer to these questions, which resulted in
inertia to get started and in some cases I was setting myself up for ever higher and greater goals.

Reading about the system approach as an alternative to goal setting made a lot of sense to me. The
system approach can be summerized as:

- Create habits and reserve your will-power for learning new habits.
- Reduce daily decisions to routine.
- Avoid setting (high) goals, instead have a system that will keep you going
- Keeping up your personal energy, which is your primary metric
- Simplicity is key

One of the key points here is the creation of (good) habits and the displine to carry it out. A
recent blog post titled:
["Screw motivation, what you need is discipline"](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/)
argues for the same point. It basically boils down to growing habits and not let yourself be driven by your emotional state.
So stop waiting until you feel good (enough) to start a particular task and get into the habit of allocating
time to just do stuff to get things done. Focus on the process (your system) and not the product
(deliverables and goals).

While in general you want to be the most productive you can be, for me having a family with the third kid
on his way (due any moment now), you have to get even more organized and disciplined to get things
done. The way in which I manage this is what I want to present to you next by outlining my system along several dimensions
that Scott describes in his book. I have been adhering to this system for a full year and besides some
minor changes and occasional missteps I'm still following through and it has definitely made a
hugely positive impact on my life and productivity.

Now without further ado, My System to Win Big:

#### Exercise
One or more of the following activities I do daily for at least 30 to 60 minutes

- Running
- Sprinting
- Push-ups / Sit-ups / Plank / Triceps-dips / 7-minute workout cycles (Honestly this is the one I
  want to become more of a routine several days a week.)
- Walking
- Cycling

#### Sports
- Football (Soccer)
- Kickboxing

#### Sleep
Needless to say you need a good amount of sleep.

- Go to bed before 00:00 (Yes, this one is hard if you do remote work for US companies from Europe)
- sleep 8 hours

#### Flexible schedule
Being flexible here means being in charge of your own schedule. Making a fixed planning and schedule for
things you want to do is higly recommended for young parents, as long as you are the one who chooses
to make time for it.

- Plan holidays/time-off
- Plan fixed slots for daily exercise and sports
- Plan stuff that makes you want to get out of bed for it

#### Diet
I'm a big proponent of the Paleo lifestyle, and try to avoid as much processed foods as possible and
keeping it real.

- Only occasionally bread/rice/potatoes
- No Candy/Cookies/Chips
- No Sodas
- No Coffee
- Occasionally alcohol (celebrations)
- Meal skipping is good
- Fasting once in a while is great (irregular intervals)
- Snacks: nuts and fruits
- Eating more vegetables by improving seasoning
- Starches like Oatmeal

#### Steadily improving / Skills
- Programming (Python, Clojure, Julia, Euler, Math)
- Book reading / knowledge gathering
- Blogging (on side-projects / programming)
- Practicing playing the Piano (still a noob here)
- [Coursera courses](http://www.coursera.com)

#### Imagine an incredible future
- related: stay optimistic and opportunistic

#### Help others
- Be there for my kids and wife
- Offer free advice and guidance for start-ups and companies
- Engage at meetups and help people out

#### Show gratitude
- Value what you already have
- Enjoy the moment

#### Have a healthy dose of Stoicism
- Avoid the persuit of materialistic goals and don't get attached to stuff

### Final words

My System helped me become more productive and happier overall. Of course my system isn't
perfect. Of course my system is tailored to suit me and can be vastly different for you.
Of course I'm still failing every so often, but at least I have my system to hold on to and to
remind me how I want things to go. Get your self into the habit of working on what matters to you
and with a little bit of luck you can win big too!
