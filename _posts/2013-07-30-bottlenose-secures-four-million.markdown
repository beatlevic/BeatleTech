Bottlenose just secured a $3.6 Million series A round to bring
'Trendfluence' to the Enterprise. With Bottlenose enterprise, while
currently in private beta, we already work with several large brands and
agencies (Pepsi, FleishmanHillard, Razorfish, and DigitasLBi) that
leverage Bottlenose Enterprise for tracking live and emerging trends
and events, directing advertising and marketing initiatives, engaging
customer communities and gathering industry intelligence.

For the actual press release please check out [Nova
Spivack's blog]("http://www.novaspivack.com/business/bottlenose-series-a-to-bring-trendfluence-to-the-enterprise")
(Bottlenose CEO), or the Techcrunch [article]("http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/30/social-media-dashboard-bottlenose-raises-3-6m/").

If we can keep current momentum at [Bottlenose]("http://bottlenose.com"), then we have a bright
future ahead of us.
