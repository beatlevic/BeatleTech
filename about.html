    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      I started my career in science working on my Phd
      in artificial intelligence,
      where after two years I made my career move to dive into startup
      life and pure software development. I am a big
      advocate of agile development, and love to work
      with like-minded developers. Yet I also like to
      teach to and collaborate with people of the
      non-technical kind. I consider myself easily
      bridging the gap between the technical and the
      business, having the required people and
      communications skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are interested to know me better and see
      whether we could do business together, then I'm
      always in for a cup of coffee or a fresh
      beer!
    </p>

      I'd like to finish with one of my favorite quotes
      borrowed from Julias Caesar, which is right up my
      alley along the lines of my "Do or Die" philosophy.
