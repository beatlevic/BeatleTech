      BeatleTech is my (Coen Stevens) freelance company
      through which I offer my services, skills and experience in developing
      web applications, recommender systems, and other
      technical solutions.

    <h2>Software Development</h2>
    <p>
      As an entrepreneur, scientist and hacker, who
      returned from silicon valley to pick the dutch
      weather over the San Francisco sunny days, I'm now
      looking for interesting job opportunities and challenges to help
      out your (startup) company, for which I'm available for freelance work. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have experience in working as a team member and as
      a team lead. As a CTO and IT architect I have been
      responsible for the overall system design, setting code
      standards, defining development processes, choosing
      technologies and application frameworks, and
      communicating all concepts clearly to every developer
      involved.

    <h2>Consultancy</h2>
    
    <p>
      Next to development I can also give advice on
      development and business strategies. As a founder of
      a <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> startup I had my fair share of the
      emotional rollercoaster that every entrepreneur goes
      through, which I love to share and teach others my
      lessons learned.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have worked on a host of different applications,
      with different technologies and frameworks. Here I'd
      like to list some of the projects that were written
      in my preferable programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my biggest interests lies in Intelligent
      systems, and more specifically in Recommender
      systems. At Wakoopa I have desiged, optimized and
      extended their recommender system in Ruby, JRuby
      and Clojure, and additionally worked in <a name="ruby">Ruby on Rails</a> on software
      classification, version number recognition and dashboard
      tools. At Newcope I continued working on building
      dashboard analytics using Ruby on Rails.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next to Ruby on Rails I have a lot of experience in
      Javascript (JQuery), and server-side javascript
      called <a name="nodejs">Node.js</a>. For Newcope I
      build a fully fledged penny auction system, which was
      a perfect fit for Node.js's asynchonous nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="clojure">Clojure</a> is where I spend most
      my time both hacking in my free time on pet projects
      and for my previous work
      at GlobalOrange on data warehouse solutions and data import parsers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my early years I have worked a lot
      with <a name="java">Java</a>, where one of my biggest
      projects was building an hours registration application.
